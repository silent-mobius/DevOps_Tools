# Intro to Configuration Management
---
Hello and welcome to mastering ansible a complete guide to configuration management and orchestration

using ansible.

I'm Chris and I'm going to be your instructor for this course throughout this course.

Not only are we going to teach you how to use ansible for basic configuration management and orchestration

tasks.

We're also going to help you build a workflow for how to use ansible to manage infrastructure at scale

using infrastructure as code principles.

We've divided this course into six sections.

We'll start out with some basic preparation talking about the environment how to get it set up that

will then move on to foundational principles of ansible such as what are tasks and how do you put them

together into place and playbooks and execute them for the bulk of the content in the course we're going

to use a quote by Kennebec as our guiding principle.

And that quote is make it work.

Make it right make it fast.

So for the three sections in the in the middle of the course we're going to first focus on getting our

environment stood up and working using ansible playbooks and modules will then move onto refactoring


And finally we'll wrap up with trying to extract more speed out of our ansible set up and look for ways

that we can get optimization and performance increases by tweaking our ansible setup.

Finally in the course we'll spend some time on troubleshooting tips and techniques and ways that you

can test and validate your ansible code as we're going along this process.

I want you to know that this is a journey where this and this course we're not just going to dive into

individual modules down in deep.

I'm not going to pull up the docs and show you a feature by feature all of the contents of ansible.

The point here is really to help you along a journey of starting from scratch and building layer by

layer.

How do you use ansible to get a real world environment stood up and then supported and maintained.

So all of this is drawing on my own experience of using ansible at scale in a big environment.

So not only are we going to help you can figure that environment but we're going to give you the artifacts

that you need to then maintain and support it using playbooks in an orchestration style workflow.

We expect that you have some systems administration background to take this course although it's not

strictly required.

The focus of the Course is really on the Ansible topics and how to take those concepts and implement

them using the ansible tool.

So although I'm going to teach you how to use the ansible apt module to install packages for instance

I expect that you already have some experience with installing packages via apt the command line already

.

So with that I'm excited about this course.

I hope you are too.

Let's get started on our journey together and to the exciting world of Ansible.
